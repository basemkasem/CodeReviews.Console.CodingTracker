# Coding Tracker

## üìñ Overview
Coding Tracker is a console application that helps developers log and track their coding sessions. It allows users to record start and end times, calculate the duration, and store the data in an SQLite database.

## ‚ú® Features
- Start and stop coding sessions
- View past coding sessions
- Track total time spent coding
- Store data in an SQLite database
- Simple console-based user interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **C#** (Console Application)
- **.NET** (Latest version recommended)
- **Dapper** (Micro-ORM for database interactions)
- **SQLite** (Lightweight database engine)
- **Spectre.Console** (For better console UI)

## üîß Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/basemkasem/CodeReviews.Console.CodingTracker
   cd CodingTracker
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to install required NuGet packages:
   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build the Project**
   ```sh

   ```

## üöÄ Usage
1. **Run the application**
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to:
   - Add a coding session
   - Update a session
   - View recorded sessions
   - Delete a session

## üìÇ Database Structure
The project uses an SQLite database file (`coding-tracker.db`) with the following table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS CodingSessions (
    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    StartTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
    EndTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
    Duration INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

## üìö Project Source
This project was inspired by the **Coding Tracker** project from [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/13/coding-tracker). It serves as a learning exercise for improving C# skills, working with databases, and building real-world console applications.
